# Watson Glaser TIS - Project Status & Verification

## ✅ Fixed Issues

### 1. Agent Profiles Missing IDs

**Problem**: `agent_profiles.js` had no `id` properties on profiles, causing:

- Advanced.html couldn't populate dropdown correctly
- Puppeteer tests couldn't select agents by ID
- Agent selection would fail silently

**Solution**: Added unique kebab-case IDs to all 10 profiles:

- `novice-student`
- `apprentice-analyst`
- `intermediate-researcher`
- `advanced-practitioner`
- `emerging-expert`
- `senior-researcher`
- `principal-investigator`
- `cognitive-architect`
- `ethics-policy-lead`
- `professor-emeritus`

### 2. Puppeteer Test Selectors

**Problem**: Test file used wrong element IDs from old HTML version:

- `#agentSelect` → should be `#agentSelector`
- `#iteration` → should be `#cycleCount`
- `#stopBtn` → should be `#startBtn` (toggle button)
- Numeric values for agent selection → should be ID strings

**Solution**: Updated all selectors and logic in `tests/puppeteer_test.js`

### 3. Deprecated Puppeteer Methods

**Problem**: Using `page.waitForTimeout()` which is deprecated

**Solution**: Replaced with custom `delay()` helper function

### 4. Frame Variable Reassignment

**Problem**: `const frame` couldn't be reassigned in fallback loop

**Solution**: Changed to `let frame`

## 🎯 Features Implemented in advanced.html

### Core TIS Engine

- ✅ Self-evolving neural parameters
- ✅ Cognitive templates (assumptions, inferences, deductions, interpretations, evaluations)
- ✅ Multi-strategy reasoning with weighted voting
- ✅ Meta-learning evolution (every 8 cycles)
- ✅ Immediate reinforcement learning (after each answer)
- ✅ Neural pattern bank (learned patterns)

### Extended Thinking (Chain-of-Thought)

- ✅ 6-step reasoning process:
  1. Question Analysis
  2. Key Concepts Identification
  3. Template Selection
  4. Option Evaluation (all 4 options)
  5. Strategy Integration
  6. Final Decision
- ✅ Visible in Developer View only

### Curriculum Learning

- ✅ Complexity levels 1-4 with gating
- ✅ Unlocks at accuracy thresholds:
  - Level 2: 70% accuracy
  - Level 3: 80% accuracy
  - Level 4: 90% accuracy
- ✅ Blocks advanced questions until unlocked

### localStorage Persistence

- ✅ Auto-saves every 5 cycles
- ✅ Saves: neuralParams, strategies, metrics, neuralBank, progress
- ✅ Manual save/load buttons
- ✅ Status indicator on save
- ✅ Timestamp tracking

### View Modes

- ✅ Learner View: Minimal UI, question/answer only
- ✅ Developer View: Full verbose with:
  - Extended thinking process
  - Neural pattern bank
  - Evolution log with metrics
- ✅ Toggle button in header

### Agent Profiles

- ✅ 10 profiles from Year 1 Student → Lifetime Career
- ✅ Unique neural parameters per profile
- ✅ Achievement badges displayed
- ✅ Dropdown selector with IDs
- ✅ Profile info card display

### Background Mode

- ✅ Silent evolution (no UI updates)
- ✅ Metrics still update
- ✅ Toggle switch with status badge
- ✅ Console logging suppressed

## 🧪 Testing

### Automated Tests (Puppeteer)

**Status**: Code fixed, but Chromium won't launch on this macOS system
**Issue**: Rosetta/arm64 compatibility warnings
**Workaround**: Use manual testing

**Test Coverage**:

- ✅ Browser 1: Direct load of advanced.html
- ✅ Browser 2: Iframe wrapper test
- ✅ Agent selection and evolution
- ✅ Screenshot capture
- ✅ Cycle tracking

### Validation Tests

**File**: `tests/validation.html`
**Status**: ✅ Ready to run

**Test Coverage** (13 tests):

1. AGENT_PROFILES loaded
2. 10 profiles exist
3. All have IDs
4. All have names
5. All have stages
6. All have neuralParams
7. All have achievements
8. IDs are unique
9. IDs are kebab-case
10. Expected IDs present
11. neuralParams.logicalDepth exists
12. neuralParams.abstractionLevel exists
13. Profile progression validated

### Manual Tests

**File**: `tests/manual_test.md`
**Checklist Items**: 8 feature areas with sub-tests

## 🚀 How to Use

### Quick Start

```bash
# Open main TIS application
open watson-glaser-trainer/advanced.html

# Or run validation tests
open watson-glaser-trainer/tests/validation.html
```

### Browser Testing

1. Open `advanced.html` in browser
2. Select an agent profile (e.g., "Intermediate Researcher")
3. Toggle Developer View to see internals
